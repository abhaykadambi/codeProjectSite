# codeProjectSite
This is a web app thingy I made for coding projects. You can upload them and other people can see and interact with them. This is just a first project.

It is kinda my first project so don't be mean please. The project is being hosted on heroku. This is the url https://codeprojectsite.herokuapp.com/.
